#### Requirements
ESP board (esp8266 or esp32 based)  
2x 3 WS2812 Leds  
USB (micro or usb-c) for connecting to power source  
3d Print the housing https://www.printables.com/model/625681-nightlighttoddler-clockok-to-wake-lightsleep-train (created by rparish_1262093, thanks!)  

## How To create
Print the housing from the link provided on Printables  
Flash WLED firmware on the ESP chip of your choise, and connect it to your WIFI  
Connect/Solder 2 strips (or 1 strip, and create segments in WLED) to your ESP chip on your favorite GPIO port  
Place the ESP and ledstrips into the housing like on the picture below (I used ledstrip diffuser strips to create a nice surface to put double sided tape behind)

1: ESP Board (used an Wemos D1 mini esp8266 based)  
2: 2 x 3 WS2812B Leds (or create one string and create segments in WLED)  
3: Usb powerconnector of the ESP, used to power the project (on the back of the light)  
Create Segments out of the upper and lower led strips, so you can controll them separately  
Connect the usb (usb-c or micro-usb) Power on the back of the Light (into the esp)

Integrate the WLED light into your Home Assistant environment  
Create to DateTime helpers for 'In Bedtime' and 'Out of Bedtime'  
Create some flows in Node Red or Home Assistant Automations to turn on or off the upper of lower part of the light  
Create a Home Assistant Card for controlling the light manually and setting the helpers for 'In Bedtime' and 'Out of Bedtime'
